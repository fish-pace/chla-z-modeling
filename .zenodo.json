  "description": "CHLA-Z is a global gridded dataset providing estimates of chlorophyll-a concentration as a function of depth (0–200 m) on a regular latitude/longitude grid, along with derived vertical-structure metrics. The product is generated using a boosted regression tree (BRT) model trained on PACE OCI Level-3 mapped remote-sensing reflectances (Rrs) and in-situ chlorophyll profile observations from Bio-Argo and OOI. This Zenodo record establishes provenance and citation for a research/draft dataset; data files are hosted in a public Google Cloud Storage bucket and accessed via cloud-native (Zarr) and NetCDF formats. Methods, validation, and uncertainty characterization are in progress.",
